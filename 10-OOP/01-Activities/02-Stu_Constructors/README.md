# 🏗️ Create Objects Using a Constructor Function

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create new objects using a constructor function.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the constructor function is named `BlogPost()` and takes in four parameters, `authorName`, `title`, `text`, and `createdOn` (this should be a date).

* It's done when the parameters are passed into the object's keys as their values.

* It's done when the object's fifth key is a method called `printMetaData()` that prints a message in the console saying `Created by (authorName) on (createdOn)`.

* It's done when I create a new object using the `BlogPost()` constructor with my own custom values.

* It's done when the meta data is printed to the console.

How can we use template literals to print an introduction like "Created by John Doe on December 5th, 2022"?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some built-in JavaScript constructors for native objects?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
