# 📖 Implement Inheritance for Multiple Classes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to instantiate several classes that inherit from a parent class.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a `ForumItem()` class is created that has properties for `authorName`, `text`, and `createdOn`.

* It's done when these properties are removed from `BlogPost()` and `Comment()`, leaving only the ones that are different for each constructor.

* It's done when `BlogPost()` and `Comment()` inherit their structure from `ForumItem()` and pass the relevant data to the parent class.

* It's done when a new instance of `BlogPost()` and `Comment()` are created and both are logged to the console to verify that they were correctly instantiated.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:
