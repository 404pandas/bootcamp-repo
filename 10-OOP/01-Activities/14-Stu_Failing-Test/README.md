# 🏗️ Write a Failing Test

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write a failing test to know what my code should do and to be confident the test can fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I can run `npm run test` and see a failing test in the terminal.

* It's done when my test code creates an instance of the `Validate` class.

* It's done when my test code calls the `isPassword` method and passes `""` (empty string) as an argument.

* It's done when my test code asserts that the expected return value is `false`.

## 💡 Hints

* What is the purpose of Jest's `expect` function?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is an End-to-End (E2E) test? What is an integration test? How are these different from a unit test?
