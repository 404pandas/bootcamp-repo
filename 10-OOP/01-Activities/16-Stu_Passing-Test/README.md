# 🏗️ Pass Failing Test for Validate isPassword() Method

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add just enough code to `isPassword()` to pass the failing test, so that I can confidently refactor and optimize my code before adding another test.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have added the least amount of code necessary to pass the failing test for the `isPassword()` method.

* It's done when I run `npm run test` in the terminal and see that all tests are passing.

* It's done when I follow the red, green, refactor workflow to add more tests until `isPassword()` is complete.

* It's done when `validate.isPassword` returns `false` given password length is less than 8.

* It's done when `validate.isPassword` returns `false` given password does not contain at least one capital letter.
  
* It's done when `validate.isPassword` returns `false` given password does not contain at least one lowercase letter.

* It's done when `validate.isPassword` returns `false` given password does not contain at least one number.

* It's done  when `validate.isPassword` returns `true` given password is a valid password. (e.g. `Password123`)

* It's done when all tests are passing.

## 💡 Hints

What is the least amount of coded needed to get a function to return `false`?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you write these tests to ensure that another developer testing your code can understand what the tests are checking?
