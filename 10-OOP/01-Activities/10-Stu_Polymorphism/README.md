# 🐛 Comment Meta Data Is Incorrect

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to run `printMetaData()` on my comment so I can see the author, date, and reaction emoji.

## Expected Behavior

When I execute `printMetaData()` on the created comment, the `authorName`, `createdOn`, and `reaction` is printed like so: `Created by (authorName) on (createdOn) (reaction)`.

## Actual Behavior

When I execute `printMetaData()` on the created comment, only `authorName` and `createdOn` are included in the output.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Open terminal and switch to the `Unsolved` folder for this activity.

2. Run `node index.js`.

## 💡 Hints

* How can I modify the `printMetaData()` for `Comment()` without changing its functionality for `BlogPost()`?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Polymorphism is one of the four pillars of OOP. What are the other 3 pillars?
